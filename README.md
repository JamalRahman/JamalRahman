### Hi, I'm Jamal 👋🏽

I'm a Machine Learning engineer, an amateaur game developer, and a decent home-cook.

- 🔭 I’m currently a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at [Builder.ai](https://builder.ai), the global leaders in AI-driven software development.
- 🌱 My AI passions are fundamentally split between LLMs, and AI for simulation. I'm a sucker for AI applications in interactive media and simulating agentic behaviour the social sciences.
- 💻 You'll probably find me working in Godot, testing game mechanic ideas!
- 🏹 Fun fact: I love archery! In 2018-19 I was a national University champion, and sponsored athlete. Though nowadays I don't have as much time for archery as I used to!
