### Hi, I'm Jamal 👋🏽

I'm a Computer Scientist, amateur game developer, and Artificial Intelligence advocate.

- 🔭 I’m currently a Machine Learning Engineer at Captify, building out NLP & IR systems, and developing our semantic understanding of search data.
- 🌱 My AI passions are fundamentally split between NLP, and AI for simulation. I'm a sucker for AI applications in interactive media and simulating the social sciences.
- 💻 You'll probably find me playing in Unity, testing game mechanic ideas!
- 🏹 Fun fact: I love archery! In 2018-19 I was a national University champion, and sponsored athlete. Though nowadays I don't have as much time for archery as I used to!

Shoutout to all my employers for not sharing Github Enterprise commits to Github public, amplifying the sparsity of my Github contribs since 2019
