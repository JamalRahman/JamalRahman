### Hi, I'm Jamal 👋🏽

I'm a Computer Scientist, amateur game developer, and Artificial Intelligence advocate.

- 🔭 I’m currently a Machine Learning Engineer at Captify, building out NLP & IR systems, and developing our ML Serving strategy.
- 🌱 My AI passions are fundamentally split between NLP, and simulation & multi-agent interaction. I'm a sucker for AI applications in the social sciences and economics.
- 💻 You'll probably find me looking into applying AI within 3D simulated environments, blending my loves for Game Dev & ML.
- 🏹 Fun fact: I'm a sponsored athlete! I discovered Archery at University and fell in love quickly, so far my peak achievement is becoming a British University Team Champion [back in 2018](https://www.facebook.com/ubarchery/videos/766284096895657)!

Shoutout to my former employer for not sharing Github Enterprise commits to Github public, amplifying the sparsity of my Github contribs 2019-2020.
