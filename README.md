### Hi, I'm Jamal ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Scientist, amateur game developer, and Artificial Intelligence advocate.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently a Data Scientist at IBM, providing Machine Learning solutions for clients in various sectors!
- ðŸŒ± My AI passions fundamentally lie in simulation & multi-agent interaction. I'm a sucker for AI applications in the social sciences and economics.
- ðŸ’» You'll probably find me looking into applying AI within 3D simulated environments, blending my loves for Game Dev & ML.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a sponsored athlete! I discovered Archery at University and fell in love quickly, so far my peak achievement is becoming a British University Team Champion [back in 2018](https://www.facebook.com/ubarchery/videos/766284096895657)!

Shoutout to IBM for not sharing Github Enterprise commits to Github public, amplifying the sparsity of my Github contribs 2019-2020.
