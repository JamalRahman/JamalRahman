### Hi, I'm Jamal 👋🏽

I'm a Computer Scientist, amateur game developer, and Artificial Intelligence advocate.

- 🔭 I’m currently a Machine Learning Engineer at Captify, building out NLP & IR systems, and developing our semantic understanding of search data.
- 🌱 My AI passions are fundamentally split between NLP & Information retrieval, and AI for simulation. I'm a sucker for AI applications in interactive media and simulating the social sciences.
- 💻 You'll probably find me playing in Unity, testing game mechanic ideas!
- 🏹 Fun fact: I'm a sponsored athlete (Thanks Everyone Active)! I discovered Archery at University and fell in love quickly, so far my peak achievement is becoming a British University Team Champion [back in 2018](https://www.facebook.com/ubarchery/videos/766284096895657)!

Shoutout to my former employer for not sharing Github Enterprise commits to Github public, amplifying the sparsity of my Github contribs 2019-2020.
